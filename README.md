# SympSense AI — Clinical Simulation Dashboard

SympSense AI is a demo clinical monitoring and simulation dashboard built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It demonstrates real-time vital sign generation, alerting agents, and a compact UI for clinical and family-facing views.

This repository is intended as a showcase and development starting point for rapid prototyping of healthcare monitoring interactions and UX patterns.

**Status:** Development / Demo

**Core technologies**: `React`, `TypeScript`, `Vite`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Recharts`

**Key features**
- Real-time vitals simulation engine (in-memory)
- Clinical alerts with severity and acknowledgement flow
- Live charts for heart rate, SpO2, and blood pressure
- Simulation controls to induce clinical scenarios (hypoxia, cardiac events, sepsis, recovery)
- Separate clinician and family UI flows

**Installation**
Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or Yarn)

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

**Development**
Start the Vite dev server and open the app in your browser:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Type-check and linting:

```powershell
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

**Build & Preview**
```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

**NPM scripts**
- `dev` — start Vite development server
- `build` — build production bundle
- `preview` — preview production build locally
- `lint` — run ESLint

**Project structure (important files)**
- `src/main.tsx` — app entry
- `src/App.tsx` — routes and layout
- `src/context/SimulationContext.tsx` — simulation engine and hooks
- `src/pages/clinical/*` — clinician views (Dashboard, PatientDetail, Settings)
- `src/pages/family/*` — family-facing views
- `src/components/ui/*` — small UI primitives (`Card`, `Badge`, etc.)
- `src/utils/helpers.ts` — simulation helpers and utilities

**Working with the simulation**
- The simulation runs in-memory in `SimulationContext`. Use the Simulation Controls on a patient detail page to switch scenarios. Alerts are generated by agents and can be acknowledged, resolved, or escalated.

**Contributing**
Contributions are welcome. Please open issues for bugs or feature requests. For code contributions:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit and open a pull request with a clear description

Keep changes focused and update types/tests where appropriate.

**Notes & Caveats**
- This project is a demo and should not be used in production clinical settings. All data and simulations are synthetic.
- Review TypeScript types in `src/types` before changing simulation logic.

**License**
This project does not include a license by default. Add a `LICENSE` file if you plan to publish or share the code.
